Pick two random notes. For each note, go up and down each string and
find the given note in the first twelve frets.

Perform this at 40 bpm using a metronome. Only set a high score in this
exercise when you can perform well with any random pair of notes.

This exercise was adopted from exercise 4 in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJddQ6Q0UDo
