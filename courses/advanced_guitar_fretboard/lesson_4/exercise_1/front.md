Pick seven random notes. For each note, go up and down each string and
find the given note in the first twelve frets.

Gradually increase the speed until you can do it at 80 bpm using a
metronome. Only set a high score in this exercise when you can perform
well with any random sequence of notes.

This exercise was adopted from exercise 6 in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJddQ6Q0UDo
