# Sing the Numbers 3

This course is based on the "Sing the Numbers 3" course, available at this
[link](https://improviseforreal.com/products/sing-numbers-3-melody-paths). The materials of the
course are not included in this course, so you will have to purchase them to practice this course,
as well as all the other courses in the series.

The exercises simply tell you which lesson to practice. There are also exercises which tell you to
practice a lesson in a random key, in order to help you practice in all keys. These exercises should
be considered mastered when you can sing the lesson comfortably in all keys.

The recommended tool for the exercises involving transposition is
[Transcribe!](https://www.seventhstring.com/xscribe/overview.html). This is proprietary and paid
software, but is by far the best option for helping you practice these exercises. It's OK to use
other tools that allow transposition.

The exercises will refer to the course using the shorthand SING3. Here are some examples:

- Practice SING3, Lesson 1.
- Practice SING3, Lesson 1, transposing it to a different random key.
