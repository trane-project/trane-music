# Rhythmic Nature of Jazz - Part 2

This course is based on the "Rhythmic Nature of Jazz" DVDs and practice tracks, available at this
[link](https://jazzbeat.com/?page_id=394). This course covers the material of the second course in
the series and the corresponding tracks.

The exercises simply tell you which tracks to listen to and practice. Some tracks are just a demo of
an exercise played by a student. So the exercises will tell you to listen to the track and then
practice the real exercise in the following track.

The exercises will refer to part 2 of the course using the shorthand RHYTHM2. Here are some
examples:

- Practice RHTYM2, Track 1.
- Listen to the demo in RHYTHM2, Track 2, then practice RHYTHM2, Track 3.
