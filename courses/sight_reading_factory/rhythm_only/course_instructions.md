Sight Reading Factory - Rhythm Only

This course goes through all rhythm only exercises from Sight Reading Factory. For each level, there
are two lessons.

1. Audiation: Generate exercises with the given parameters and listen to them. First audiate them in
   your head as you listen to them and then sight sing them. The goal of this lesson is to learn the
   correspondence between the notation and the sound before you are asked to read it.
2. Sight Reading: This follows the audiation lesson. Generate exercises with the given parameters
   and sight sing them.
