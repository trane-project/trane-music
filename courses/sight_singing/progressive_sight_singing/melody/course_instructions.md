# Progressive Sight Singing - Melodic Reading

This course is based on the book "Progressive Sight Singing", 3rd edition, by Carol Kruger.
This course covers the melodic reading section of the book. A separate course covers the rhythmic
reading section.

The exercises will refer to the book using the shorthand PROGRESSIVE. Here are some examples:

- Practice PROGRESSIVE, Melodic Reading, Chapter 1.3, Pattern A.1.
- Practice PROGRESSIVE, Melodic Reading, Chapter 1.4, Exercise 1.

For the melodic exercises, you should first practice the exercises in the key given in the book.
Once that is sufficiently mastered, you should practice the exercises in a random key.
